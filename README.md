# Linear-Regression
Simple Linear Regression [Input-Output Sowing Linear Relation(SLR)]


DEFINITION :  SLR is a type of regression algorithm that models the realtionship between a dependent(TARGET) and "single" independent variable


LINEAR EQUATION : y=mx=+c


WHERE:
y=dependent varibale
x=independent variable
m= slope / coefficient
c= intercept

#Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

Definition:

Multiple Linear Regression is a statistical method to predict the value of a dependent variable (target) based on two or more independent variables (features).

It extends Simple Linear Regression to multiple features.

Equation:

Key Points:

Uses two or more independent variables.

Fits a hyperplane instead of a straight line.

Evaluates impact of each feature on the target.

Common metrics for evaluation: R² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE).
